# BattleShips
Remake of BattleShips in Java
It is a remake of battleships on a 5x5 grid with three different ship types.
To play you will need to run the **App.java** file with all of the other files in the **src** folder as well.
In the future I will be adding to the game by adding a way to play against a very primitive AI in a single player mode
